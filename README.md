# Pandas Project Project

This project involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and Python, focusing on analyzing student grades in a university course.

## Project Overview

The project simulates the role of a data analyst at a university. The main objective was to analyze student grades and provide insights into their performance, while also identifying patterns and making recommendations for improving outcomes.

This was a **self-guided project**, meaning no external help from instructors was provided, and the focus was on using available resources, simulating a real-world scenario where analysts must work independently.

## Key Tasks

1. **Library Import:** Imported essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, etc.
2. **EDA on Student Data:**
   - Loaded and cleaned student data.
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the dataset to uncover patterns.
3. **Homework Grade Analysis:**
   - Analyzed homework grades using lambda filters for better filtering and calculation.
4. **Quiz Data Processing:**
   - Managed multiple quiz data files by creating a structured approach to read and store data efficiently.
   - Processed and merged the data with proper handling of missing values.
5. **Percentage Calculation for Exams:**
   - Calculated percentage scores using a formula for obtained marks over total marks.
6. **Homework Performance:**
   - Utilized `set_axis` and calculated homework averages for students based on maximum possible scores.
7. **Regex for Quiz Columns:**
   - Used regular expressions to filter out relevant quiz columns for analysis.
8. **Final Output:**
   - Grouped data and performed final calculations, writing the processed data into a CSV file.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python** 
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**

## Key Learnings

- Performing data cleaning and handling missing values
- Using regex for column filtering
- Applying Pandas functions like `set_axis` and `merge` for data structuring
- Working with lambda functions for efficient data processing
